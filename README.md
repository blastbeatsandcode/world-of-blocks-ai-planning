# World of Blocks AI Planning

Solving the famous World of Blocks Artificial Intelligence problem using planning.


## Set Up (Linux)
**BEFORE CONTINUING**: Please see [here](http://python.cocos2d.org/doc/programming_guide/installation.html) for installation instructions for Cocos2D, including `six` and `pyglet`. And of course you will be needing `python 3`. This will give you a full install of Cocos2D for other projects if you're interested. This guide will help you set up an environment for this particular project.
The setup will be similar in most operating systems, but there might be some slight differences.

**Create a Virtual Environment**

To set things up, we will want to create a virtual environment for Cocos2D. 
```bash
virtualenv cocos_env
```

To run this virtual environment so we can set everything up for it, we want to activate it by changing into the new directory and running the activate script
```bash
source cocos_env/bin/activate
```
Now we are running in a python virtual environment. From here, we can make custom installs for this project.

Install pyglet and Cocos2D.

```bash
pip3 install pyglet
pip3 install cocos2d
```
